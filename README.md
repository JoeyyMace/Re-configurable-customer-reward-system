Tasks
1. A customer reward system is a software that tracks the customer’s shopping behavior and reward points
to the customer. The software provides the following services
2.  Product management: the shop manager should be able to add and remove products from inventory. Each product should have the following information
3.  Reward management: this service allows the manager to specify the following
    (a) The number of points awarded for a given shopping amount.
    (b) The gifts that can be redeemed given the total number of reward points.

    • Product addition.
    • Product removal.
    • Shopping.
    • View customer using customer ID.
    • Redeem rewards.
5. The system should load any previously saved data.
6. The system should perform data validation for all input data

Write a C++ code to implement this software application. Your code must follow the following guidelines:
• No more than one statement per line.
• You must use block indentation.
• All nesting of if statements should not exceed a depth of two.
• All if statements must have an else statement.
• Each function must be documented by specifying the role of that function and the meaning of
each parameter and return values.
• Functions code should not exceed 35 statements.
• The cyclomatic complexity of any function should not exceed 10.
• Must reuse functions as much as possible.
• The project should not be implemented in a single cpp file. You must have at least four files.

Contributions

At the time of making this repository it has been probably about a year since I worked on this so I may leave out some stuff. 
Based on my memory the main components I worked on in this project are the creation, adding, and removing of customers and products, as well as some input validation, and some of the layout in the main menu on the main file. The transactions and reward system were not made by me. My main contributions were to the customers.cpp file and the products.cpp file.
